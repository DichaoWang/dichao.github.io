Feng Xiaoqin urged her husband Gu Lei to borrow money from her twin sister Gu Qingyu to buy a house, but was cleverly resolved by Gu Qingyu and revealed her plan to buy a luxury house. After Gu Lei's unexpected death, conflicts between his sister-in-law continued to escalate, and single mother Feng Xiaoqin was almost hopeless, but it also began the process of exploring her own value. She relied on her own wisdom and resilience to plan a nursing home "not too late" and make it bigger and stronger. Gu Qingyu reshaped his understanding of life in reality and dreams, from flash marriage to divorce, in order to fulfill his teenage dreams. Two women, from opposition to mutual understanding, will carry this family together no matter how stormy the future may be.</p>

                                <p class="film_description">Spring Fever is a 2009 Chinese/French film directed by Lou Ye. The production of the film is in defiance of a five-year ban on filmmaking imposed by China's State Administration of Radio, Film, and Television (SARFT) for his previous film, Summer Palace. Filmed in Nanjing, the film was described to be about a young threesome overcome with erotic longings.

                                By the time of the film's premiere at the Cannes Festival on 13 May 2009, it was known that Lou had circumvented the five-year ban imposed upon him after Summer Palace by having Spring Fever registered as a Hong Kong/French co-production.</p>
